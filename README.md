#### What I think
 ----
 I have made this program to find the most popular word in a daily stockmarket report. 
 I have found that the most used words are pretty cool. The is always the most used word and i could not take it out because I think it 
 is interesting to see how much it is used .
 
 Another thing that I found interestion is to put comments into this program. The most used word in the comments are pretty cool.
