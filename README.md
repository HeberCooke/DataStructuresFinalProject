    ---
* This program takes the data from a text area and counts each occurance of all the words. 
    It gives the option to sort the words three different ways, In order of occurance, in 
    alphibetical order and in order of most used first. 
* The program can take a file or copy and paste into the data entry text field.

#### What I think
 ----
 I have made this program to find the most popular word in a daily stockmarket report. 
 I have found that the most used words are pretty cool. The is always the most used word and i could not take it out because I think it 
 is interesting to see how much it is used .
 
 Another thing that I found interestion is to put comments into this program. The most used word in the comments are pretty cool.
