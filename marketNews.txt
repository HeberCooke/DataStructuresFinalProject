It was a rough way to end the week on Friday as stocks fell sharply and ended near session lows following a round of disappointing economic data out of Europe and as Treasury yields plummeted, causing an inversion of the U.S. Treasury yield curve that raised worries over global growth. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped around 460 points, or 1.8%, to end near 25,503, while the S&P 500 fell 1.9% to close near 2,801 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 2.5% to end near 7,643. The move pulled major averages off 4-month peaks reached just the session before. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell nearly 8 basis points to 2.459%, a fresh 15-month low, briefly dipping below the three-month T-bill at 2.459%, raising recession fears. Meanwhile, the Cboe Volatility Index (VIX) spiked 24% to 16.96 on Friday.
